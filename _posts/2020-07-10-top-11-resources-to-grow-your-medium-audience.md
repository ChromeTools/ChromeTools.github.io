While developing [The Medium Auto Follow Bot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh), I did *a lot* of research into the topic of growing your [Medium](https://medium.com/) audience.  Here are the top 11 resources that I found with tips on how to grow your Medium audience.

# 1. [How to Grow Your Audience on Medium](https://blog.medium.com/how-to-grow-your-audience-on-medium-307f879a3468) by [Elizabeth Tobey](https://medium.com/@dahanese)

This one was written in 2016, so I'm not sure how relevant it's content is anymore considering the [Medium partner program](https://medium.com/me/partner/enroll/terms) wasn't even available back then. That said, it has some useful tips such as "Start talking with, not just at" and "Get tactical about growth" (the [Medium Auto Follow Bot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh) happens to be one such tactic).
    
# 2. [10 Easy And Quick Ways To Grow Your Audience On Medium](https://medium.com/thought-pills/10-easy-and-quick-ways-to-grow-your-audience-on-medium-feb89bd927b6) by [Yann Girard](https://medium.com/@girard_yann)

This one reads like a poem.  The way Yann spaces out his sentences is interesting and unique to his style.  His main tips are "FOLLOW PEOPLE WHO LIKE YOUR STUFF", "FOLLOW PEOPLE WHO LIKE SIMILAR STUFF TO YOURS", and "FOLLOW PEOPLE WHO FOLLOW PEOPLE SIMILAR TO YOU" which align with [The Medium Auto Follow Bot's](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh) primary use case.

# 3. [My “Secret” to Quickly Building an Epic Audience on Medium](https://writingcooperative.com/my-secret-to-quickly-building-an-epic-audience-on-medium-18688ecf5c1f) by [Nick Wignall](https://writingcooperative.com/@nickwignall)

The best piece of advice in this post is "How to Find Friends on Medium".  [The Medium Auto Follow Bot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh) can help with this, but what this section in Nick's post does, is tell you which users you should be following with [The Medium Auto Follow Bot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh).  You should be following people who: 

1. Have the same audience size as you
2. Who's writing you admire
3. Are writing about a topic you're interested in


# 4. [7 Medium Optimization Tips To Get Your Articles To Go Hot](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/ws/2016/07/19/medium-optimization-tips) by [Larry Kim](https://medium.com/@larrykim)

Larry's main points in this post are

* Use a great image.
* Spend a few bucks on social ads to give your post a little push.
* Work with Medium publications for more exposure.
* Kill underperforming posts and bring them back.
* Add more Twitter and Facebook followers.
* Follow people who like your posts.
* Post regularly.

The best tip here is to kill underperforming posts and resurrect them from the dead later.  One thing any seasoned content creator will tell you is how random engagement can be.

# 5. [7 Easy Ways to Get More Views on Medium](https://medium.com/the-mission/7-easy-ways-to-get-more-views-on-medium-519bff6befd1) by [Larry Kim](https://medium.com/@larrykim)
Man...this Larry guys is on fire! :fire: :fire: :fire:  

Oh wait, this is the same post that's on his blog with a different title! In this case, the "Medium" is the message (pun intended :wink:).

# 6. [How To Skyrocket Your Medium Followers To 1,000 In 4 Months (2020 Update)](https://medium.com/swlh/how-to-skyrocket-your-medium-followers-to-1-000-in-4-months-72ce7592775f) by [Jesse Kerema](https://medium.com/@jessekerema)

Jesse's 2020 update includes, you guessed it: "Download the app, follow Influencers, turn on notifications".  Hmm... [following influencers?](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh) you might be sensing a theme at this point.


# 7. [I Just Passed 100 Followers on Medium; Here’s 5 Lessons I Learned](https://writingcooperative.com/i-just-passed-100-followers-on-medium-heres-5-lessons-i-learned-db5f727e3b0b) by [Jordan Ebert](https://writingcooperative.com/@_EbertJ)

What I like about Jordan's post is it's 100 followers.  This makes the content more realistic, reasonable, and achievable for beginning Medium writers.  The best tip in this post is

> A great blog post isn’t the same as a great story

You need to be creating content specifically for Medium if you're trying to grow your Medium audience.

# 8. [Going Viral: How I got 10k Views on Medium in 4 days](https://growandconvert.com/content-marketing/going-viral-medium/) by [Benji Hyam](https://medium.com/@benjihyam)

Benji's post is the most analytic of the 11.  There is a lot of analysis in this post and *tons* of great insights such as:

1. Make sure you study what does well on Medium and write a story that is vulnerable, invokes emotion, and/or one that talks about a controversial issue.
2. Make sure you choose a short and interesting headline for your story coupled with a descriptive subhead or one that makes the reader curious to learn more.
3. Format your post so that it’s easy for a reader to navigate through it. Make sure to call out quotes.
4. Find the perfect publication for your article to call home.
5. Do whatever it takes to get 100 recommendations on your post in the first hour of publishing. This means growing your following on Medium (:thinking: I wonder if [The Medium Auto Follow Bot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh) can help with that), reaching out to friends, mailing your e-mail list, sharing on social media and being creative to drive those 100 recommendations.

# 9. [How to Find Followers on Medium](https://blog.markgrowth.com/how-to-find-followers-on-medium-e9029bc3062b) by [Carter Barnett](https://blog.markgrowth.com/@cartermbarnett)

This biggest take away in this article is to *engage with the community*.  [I wonder if there is a tool](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/medium-auto-follow-bot/lkadfcgddddohiiajfjejcmdmapaeagh) that could help with this?


# 10. [How to Gain [Big Number] Medium Followers in [Short Timeframe]](https://kantantechnology.com/how-to-gain-25k-medium-followers-in-7-days-450401f2e3f9) by [Cody Monson](https://kantantechnology.com/@codymonson)

This one is my favorite because it's the only one that recognizes how many of these "How to grow your Medium audience" articles there are out there.  Most importantly though, it has content-centric suggestions, such as learning something new so you have something to say in your writing.

# 11. [10 Tips to Get Your Work Noticed on Medium](https://prowritingaid.com/art/883/10-tips-to-get-your-work-noticed-on-medium.aspx) by [Kristin Savage](https://medium.com/@kristinwsavage)

Last but not least is Kristin's post!  This one has some useful information such as posting on Saturday morning, as the weekends are when people are looking for things to read and to publish regularly.
